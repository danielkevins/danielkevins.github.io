                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded" style="font-size: small">
                        This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the trends and conditions of professionals in the data industry based on the results of a survey that has been conducted. I began this process by conducting exploratory data analysis to understand the structure of the data, then developing informative interactive visualizations using Power BI. These visualizations are designed to embed the analysis results into an easy-to-understand narrative with an infographic approach.
                        I illustrated this concept through data that includes demographic profiles (country of origin, age and number of respondents), technology preferences, job satisfaction levels, average salaries by profession, and the level of difficulty in entering the data industry. My findings revealed interesting patterns that are both qualitative and quantitative, such as the dominance of the Python programming language, moderate satisfaction with salaries, and the distribution of respondents from various countries.</p>
                    <h4>Explanation</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded" style="font-size: small">
                        1. Country of Survey Takers
This section displays the geographic distribution of survey respondents through a Treemap visualization.
The majority of respondents are from the United States, which is seen to dominate the visualization space.
Countries such as India, the United Kingdom, and Canada have a significant proportion of respondents.
The Other category indicates the involvement of participants from various other countries with smaller numbers, but is still important to show geographic diversity.<br>
2. Happiness Metrics (Salary & Work/Life Balance)
This section uses a Gauge Chart to display the level of satisfaction of respondents regarding:
Happiness with Salary: The average satisfaction score is 4.27 (scale 10), indicating that most respondents are still not completely satisfied with the compensation they receive.
Happiness with Work/Life Balance: The average score reaches 5.74, which means that the balance between work and personal life is considered better than satisfaction with salary.<br>
3. Average Age and Count of Survey Takers
Here, two key metrics are highlighted:
Average Age: 29.87 years old indicates that this survey is dominated by young professionals working in the data field.
Total Respondents: 630 people participated, giving credibility to the survey results.<br>
4. Favorite Programming Language
This section uses a Stacked Bar Chart to show programming language preferences based on Job Title:
Python dominates as the favorite programming language with the highest number of voters across all professions.
Languages ​​such as R, C/C++, JavaScript, and Java have significantly fewer voters.
The difference in preferences across professions shows that certain programming languages ​​are more relevant for specific job titles.<br>
5. Average Salary by Job Title
A Bar Chart visualization is used to show the average salary by profession:
Data Scientist has the highest average salary, followed by Data Engineer and Data Architect.
Professions such as Data Analyst, Database Developer, and Student/Looking for Job have lower salaries.<br>
6. Difficulty to Break Into Data
This section uses a Donut Chart to illustrate how difficult respondents find the process of breaking into the data industry:
42.7% of respondents stated that the process is "Neither Easy nor Difficult" (moderate).
24.76% felt "Easy", indicating that many had a positive experience.
While 21.27% felt "Difficult", and a small number stated "Very Easy" or "Very Difficult".
These results indicate that the data industry has moderate barriers to entry, depending on skill background, access to learning resources, and job opportunities.
